                    We have 2 people to thank: Greg’s college friend Kevin Sullivan &amp; the good people at Goose Island. It was Kevin’s bachelor party that brought a crazy bunch of animals to Chicago in September 2014. Greg loves Goose Island and wanted to go to the 312 Urban Block Party that Goose was hosting. Luckily the Cubs game was moved up earlier, so that made way for day-drinking at a ballgame, then straight to the block party. And Megan went with friends because she loves beer and a good Chicago street fest.
                </p>
                <p class="regular-text">
                    Kevin randomly found Megan in the beer line and made a proposal: “Hey! Give me a token for me and you and I’ll go cut the line &amp; get us beer.” Megan obviously agreed. From there she was introduced to the wild gang at a picnic table. Kevin mentioned Greg lives in New Jersey and, as a Jersey Girl, she was pleased to see an empty seat next to him.

                <p class="regular-text">
                    The guys were calling her Red and Shawty all night, asking where to go and what to do in Chicago. Shawty suggested going to her favorite blues bar, Kingston Mines. But first, they had to check deep dish pizza off their list. Someone (not Greg!) invited her to go to Gino’s East with them and then they’d make their way to Kingston Mines. Not everyone in the bachelor crew made it to Kingston Mines, but it was an epic night - as Kingston Mines nights always are. Greg asked for Megan’s number, Megan wondered why the hell a guy in New Jersey would ask a girl in Chicago for her number, but she gave it anyway.
                </p>
                <p class="regular-text">
                    They got to know each other long distance (799 miles!): going over Greg’s text limit (sorry, Jets!), g-chatting all day every day, Skype sessions &amp; phone calls. Soon this “fun thing” became something bigger: they totally fell for each other. Greg’s first visit to see Megan was Halloween weekend, where they did a couples’ costume (not even a couple yet!) as Salt & Peppa, they had their first date November 1 and Megory was created. After 7 months of long distance, Greg moved to Chicago in May 2015.

                <p class="regular-text">
                    Greg popped the question to Megan on October 22, 2016 while on the Chicago Architectural Foundation boat tour - an activity they love bringing out of town guests on!

                    Megan was born in New Jersey, grew up in Virginia Beach, went to school at Flagler College in St. Augustine, FL. She lived in Sarasota, FL for 4 years before packing up her car and moving to Chicago in 2012. She works in social media, hates when people don’t use their blinkers and loves pizza, winning tickets to concerts and Old Style - Chicago’s beer.

                    Greg is a born and raised Long Island boy, went to school at Providence College in RI, and worked for the Jets his entire professional career... until he met Megan. He moved to Chicago in May 2015 and works at a startup as a senior software developer. He hates Tom Brady and loves tacos, the Mets and Megan’s dance moves.
